# Kth-Level-Of-A-Binary-Tree
The C++ code constructs a binary tree from a preorder traversal and then prints all nodes at a specific level k using recursion.The kthLevel function is the core of the problem's solution. It uses a recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) to find and print all nodes at level k.
